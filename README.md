[See Live]()

This website shows the top 100 albums on iTunes at any given time. I have used [React](https://reactjs.org) to build it.

## Guide

To develop use:

```text
npm start
yarn start
```

And It runs on

```text
localhost:3000
```

For production build use:

```text
npm build
yarn build
```

## Development server

Run `yarn start` or `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm build` or `yarn build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
